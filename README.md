#Screen Time Analyzer

## What is this project about?
A beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes digital habits using simulated 7-day screen time data.

## What I did:
1. Created sample screen time data for 7 days
2. Analyzed the data (totals, averages, patterns)
3. Created charts to visualize the data
4. Generated insights about my digital habits

## Files in this project:
- `screen_time_analyzer.ipynb` - Main notebook with all code
- `README.md` - This file (project explanation)
- `screen_time_outputs/` - Folder with generated results

## How to run:
1. Open in Google Colab or VS Code
2. Run all cells
3. Check the output files

## What I learned:
- How to use pandas for data analysis
- How to create charts with matplotlib
- How to find patterns in data
- How to organize a data science project

## Next steps:
1. Learn to work with real data
2. Learn more visualization techniques
3. Build more complex projects
