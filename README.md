# Screen Time Analyser

## Project Overview
A beginner-friendly Python data analysis project that explores digital habits using simulated 7-day screen time data.

The project focuses on understanding how screen time is distributed across different categories, applications, and days of the week.

## What I Did
- Simulated realistic screen time data for multiple app categories  
- Generated a 7-day dataset with weekdays and weekends  
- Cleaned and organized data using pandas  
- Performed category-wise, daily, and app-level analysis  
- Created multiple visualizations to identify usage patterns  
- Calculated basic productivity metrics  
- Exported analysis results as CSV files

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## Key Analysis Performed
- Total and average screen time calculations  
- Category-wise and app-wise usage analysis  
- Weekday vs weekend comparison  
- Trend analysis using line charts  
- Heatmap to visualize activity patterns  
- Basic productivity scoring using weighted categories  

## How to Run
1. Open `screen_time_analyser.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. View generated visualizations and exported CSV files  

## Key Learnings
- Data simulation and preprocessing  
- Grouping and aggregation with pandas  
- Visualizing patterns using matplotlib and seaborn  
- Structuring a complete beginner's data analysis project
